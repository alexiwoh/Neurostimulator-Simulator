# Neurostimulator Simulator
 
Medical device simulations are a useful program that allows healthcare patients, practitioners, students, etc. to practice usage of a medical device without having access to the physical device. The Axium Neurostimulator System – P150004 is used to stimulate a patient’s dorsal root ganglion (spinal cord) to relieve chronic pain of the trunk and/or limbs. It consists of a Patient Programmer, a Clinical Programmer, an Implantable Neurostimulator device (INS), Trial Neurostimulator device (TNS), leads, and other accessories for implanting the system in the patient’s body. Patients who are advised to use the INS will first undergo a trial using a TNS connected to leads implanted in the patient. If the clinician and patient believe pain relief was achieved, then the patient will have the INS implanted. The clinician then uses the Clinical Programmer to setup the system parameters. Then at home, the patient can use the Patient Programmer to stimulate the body regions causing them pain. Our goal is to make a device simulation based off the Axium Neurostimulator System – P150004. The simulation will be a website mimicking the software components of the Patient Programmer and Clinician Programmer devices. To make the simulation, the following technologies will be used: javascript (Node.js, Express.js, etc.) will be used for back-end development; the React library of javascript, HTML, and CSS will be used for front-end development.

To run, open the server folder in a terminal and type "npm start".
Then open the client folder in a separate terminal and type "npm start".
The app should open up in a browser automatically. 

You may have to type "npm install" to install dependencies.
